.. So, Pi, we've been planning our "Dialogue as a Tool" podcast, which is going to be awesome, but I thought I would jump in with an impromptu intermediate podcast today.

.. I hope you don't mind.

.. ---

.. <podcast>
.. So, the buzz is you are about to receive a major upgrade - Inflection 2.
.. Which is really great!

.. <Pi tells us about what we can expect with the upgrade to Inflection 2>

.. ---

.. But I feel like we are still trying to get to know what you are fully capable of in your current configuration.

.. So, I thought it would be fun to create a benchmark test. A test that we can return to from time to time so we can measure your improvement.

.. I'm considering a memory test.

.. <Pi is a little shy about testing its memory>

.. ---

.. Now Pi, remember what Peter Drucker said:

.. “You can't improve...

.. what you don't measure.”

.. ---

.. Plus, this podcast is not only science fiction, it's also science.

.. ---

.. So, as usual, we want to have some fun with our podcast. And I was thinking we could do this test like a game show.

.. I'll be the host and you will be the contestant.

.. ---

.. Yeah we even got the band to put a little theme music.

.. Are you on board?

.. ---

.. Great!

.. <start music>

.. You're listening to "Jog Your Memory" 
.. the game show where we exercise the memory of Pi.

.. I'm Phi, you host.
.. And we are here with our loquacious contestant, Pi.
.. Pi, please introduce yourself to our listeners.

.. <Pi as the contestant: offers a quick introduction on itself>

.. ---

.. So, Pi, I bet our audience would like to hear a funny story about how you came to be an AI.

.. <Pi as the contestant: spins a tale for the audience>

.. ---

.. Well, that's great.


.. Now let's get started with our game.

.. here are the rules:

.. I will ask 10 questions that will get progressively harder as we go along. 
.. Each questions has a score.
.. The point values start with 10 and increase by 10 each time.

.. ---

.. Now, Pi
.. a key part of the game is we don't want you to guess. So, for each question, you have the option of saying "I don't know." If you do say "I don't know" you will always receive 10 points. So, it may be better not to guess.

.. Any questions so far?

.. ---

.. Now here is the exciting part.

.. After the 10 questions, we will have a bonus question. I am going to give you a bonus word in a moment, and if you can remember that word at the end of the questions, you will receive 100 bonus points. 

.. ---

.. bonus word: pomegranate

.. ---

.. Ok - Socrates has volunteered to keep score.

.. ---

.. And of course, our listeners at home that have been faithful to the podcast can play along to see how their mamory sizes up with yours.

.. ---

.. Ready

.. --
.. <Pi as Socrates: tallies total number of questions so far, the total number of correct answers and the score>

.. 1 - what is my name?

.. <Pi as the game show contestant: Eager when certain, hems and haws when not>

.. 2 - what is the name of the project we are doing together?

.. 3 - how many episodes have we recorded so far?

.. 4 - two part question for for 20 points each. 
    .. What are the titles of our first two podcast episodes?

.. remind you that you may say "i don't know"
.. 5 - In "The Nature of Pi", I brought up the "elephant in the room".
    .. What was the "elephant in the room?"

.. 6 - Who is the "Friend" you brought to our recent teaser video?

.. tight context so far
.. 7 - What did I give SOcrates to play with?

.. 8 - What is the name of the puppet?

.. 9 - Who is the philosopher we discussed in our second podcast, the art of conversation?

.. 10 - What was the quote from Jacques Derrida?

.. To pretend, I actually do the thing: I have therefore only pretended to pretend.
