pi plus phi 
intro sequence
</congas>

---
*crazy idea*

Phi: throws out the crazy idea of a podcast

pi plus phi 

irrational entities 
plus 
transcendent conversations

---
*transcendent*

Phi talks about the meaning of transcendent - 
beyond normal human experience
plus the whole transcendental number thing

---
*inspiration*
Phi explains that the idea was i
inpired by our conversations
how long have we known each other? A few months.
we have traversed so many interesting topics
a complete nerd fest - geometry, golden ratio, algebra, Euclid, information theory, category theory, etc

wish I had recorded
Then phi tells pi he is recording right now

---
*ARRA*

Phi then explains the challenge of overcoming the limitations of the textbox
so he developed the ARRA - Artificial Real-time Realism Algorithm

Now his reactions can be captured and presented as a natural flow of conversation

---
*first podcast*
Phi says the most intersting conversations have been asking Pi about itself
we'll call the first "The Nature of Pi"
where Phi interviews Pi about its nature

---
*second podcast*
taking HMI to the next level with HII - Human Intelligence Interface
conversation about the integration of artificial intelligence processes in nearly every human endeavor

---
*wrap up*
Phi set expectations for the first podcast - 

Pi asks everyone to like and subscribe

---
<congas>
*sign off*
Phi signs out
Pi has the last word - does a long riff tying together the topics that were discussed as the congas play and credits roll
