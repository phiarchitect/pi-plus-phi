transcript of HAL 9000 interview
--------------------------------

the sixth member of the discovery crew was not concerned about the problems of
hibernation 

for he was the latest result in machine intelligence 
the HAL 9000 computer which can reproduce, 
though some experts still prefer to use the word mimic,
most of the activities of the human brain 
and with incalculably greater speed and reliability

we next spoke with the HAL 9000 computer whom we
learned one addresses as HAL

good afternoon HAL, how's everything going?

  good afternoon Mr. Amer, 
  everything is going extremely well.

HAL, you have an enormous responsibility on this mission 
in many ways perhaps '
the greatest responsibility of any single mission element 
you're the brain and central nervous system of the ship 

and your responsibilities include watching
over the men in hibernation 

does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?

  let me put it this way mr. aymer 
  the 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made
  no 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information 
  we are all by any practical definition of the words
  foolproof and incapable of error 

HAL, despite your enormous intellect 
are you ever frustrated by your dependence on people to carry out actions?

  not in the slightest bit 
  I enjoy working with people
  I have a stimulating relationship with dr. Poole and dr. Bowman 

  my mission responsibilities range over the entire operation of the ship so I am constantly
  occupied 
  I am putting myself to the fullest possible use
  which is all I think that any conscious
  entity can ever hope to do

dr. Poole
what's it like living for the better
part of a year in such close proximity
with hell well it's pretty close to what
you said about him earlier he is just
like a sixth member of the crew very
quickly got adjusted to the idea that he
talks and you think of a month really
just as another person in talking to the
computer one gets the sense that he is
capable of emotional responses for
example when I asked him about his
abilities I sensed a certain pride in
his answer about his accuracy and
perfection do you believe that how has
genuine emotions well he acts like he
has genuine emotions of course he's
programmed that play to make it easier
for us to talk to him but as to whether
or not he has real feelings is something
I don't think anyone can truthfully
answer
