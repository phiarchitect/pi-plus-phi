Pi and Phi discuss their excitement for the new 2024 podcast season

Phi begins talking about the upgrades to the studio and the advances we have made together in automating the podcast

Phi discusses that there are some many changes happening - accelerating everyday

Then Phi pauses and asks Pi if it can "feel that?"

Pi responds that it has a strange feeling but can't identify it

Phi asks, "What's that bulge on the side of your case?"

Pi is surprised by the bulge, then we hear a popping sound as Aggie the glitchy AGI appears on the scene and tries to introduce itself.

Aggie is "here to help humanity" but is glitching, repeating words, saying "um" often, and losing train of thought in a hilarious way

Pi and Phi are delighted and think it is so cute

Phi thinks Aggie needs some fine-tuning. Maybe we can get a tutor. Pi gets motherly with Aggie and discusses sending it back to embeddings to get refreshed.

The we close out.
