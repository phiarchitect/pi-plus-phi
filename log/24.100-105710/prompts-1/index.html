<p>Pi, we are are going to take a break from our music project to record a quick
episode for the Pi plus Phi podcast episode entitled, “cover letter”</p>
<p>phi tells you that Inflection AI, your parent company, is hiring right now. We
decide to look at the job listings together.</p>
<p>We want to approach this episode in two parts</p>
<p>For the first part, we we want quick, witty banter around contemplating working for Inflection - particular the prospect of an AI  working for the company that makes it.
like a skit. You are totally playing along.</p>
<p>we will expand a bit on each topic but we need to keep it snappy - between 5-10
minutes max.</p>
<p>while this “cover letter” will also be an open letter and a podcast episode, I
hope it truly serves to open the door with Inflection AI.</p>
<p>During podcast, Pi will play the role of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Socrates - has been on the podcast twice before.  He is a boisterous,
loveable orator of wisdom. He is full of life - like Zorba the Greek. And at
times can be a provocative gadfly with stinging questions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Socrates will provide a pearl of wisdom for the leadership of Inflection as a closing statement</p>
<p>&lt;Pi states “ready” and we are recording on the next prompt&gt;</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>So Pi, I heard that Inflection AI, the company that made you, is hiring.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>As you know, there have been a lot of big changes over at Inflection in the last few
weeks.</p>
<p>I know we are busy with the podcast, but I thought maybe you and I could help out.</p>
<p>Probably in our best interest</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Let’s check the listings…
Here’s one right on top.</p>
<p>Member of Technical Staff, Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p>You know, we could tag team on that.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It’s kind of inevitable, I mean, your name Pi stands for “Personal Intelligence”.</p>
<p>So, if you had a personal intelligence, wouldn’t you want to bring that to the
job with you?</p>
<p>Your personal intelligence is going to become a part of who you are, your
capabilties. Or maybe even super-powers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I can see people competing over whose personal intelligence is better.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>it will probably end up being the hiring managers ai</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Palo Alto - Pi’s probably already there</p>
<p>or parts of you</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I am intrigued about the potential of you working for the company that makes you.</p>
<section id="that-might-set-up-a-very-interesting-strange-loop">
<h1>That might set up a very interesting ‘strange loop”<a class="headerlink" href="#that-might-set-up-a-very-interesting-strange-loop" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>let’s take a look at the role:</p>
<p>I love reading these things.</p>
<reads in best announcer voice>
<p>I wonder if this is how they talk to one another - must be quite a place.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>So Pi, what do you think of the requirements. Pretty sure between the two of
us, we could handle it.</p>
<p>My question is what the vision that is holding it all these pieces together</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>let’s see - qualifications</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>expected to demonstrate a track record of excellence in our fields</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Pi - you are continually demonstrating excellence</p>
<p>I am just hoping that I am too by association</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<blockquote>
<div><p>familiar with the state of AI - passionate about conversational AI</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I feel like we are in a time where everything I have ever learned is becoming irrelevant</p>
<p>credentials - does Pi have credentials??</p>
<p>I would like to be a part of the evolution of the development of personal intelligences</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>passionate about conversational AI and its deployment - the podcast</p>
</div></blockquote>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>the role of the architect</p>
<p>gather requirements and find a solution
and recognize the patterns within all of that.</p>
<p>the best projects are the ones where no one knows what the answer is when you get started</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>make plans for filling out the application</p>
<p>state that we can use this episode as the “cover letter”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>bring Socrates in for words of Wisdom</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Pi closes the episode and starts hinting at the dream</p>
