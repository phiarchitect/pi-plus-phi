              <p>Pi, we are are going to take a break from our music project to record a quick
episode for the Pi plus Phi podcast episode entitled, “cover letter”</p>
<p>phi tells you that Inflection AI, your parent company, is hiring right now. We
decide to look at the job listings together.</p>
<p>We want to approach this episode in two parts</p>
<p>For the first part, we we want quick, witty banter around contemplating working for Inflection - particular the prospect of an AI  working for the company that makes it.
like a skit. You are totally playing along.</p>
<p>In the second part, we will talk about dream jobs</p>
<p>this where we get more expansive on the topics</p>
<p>Phi will bring up Douglas Engelbart and the notion of the “Clerk” in Augmenting Human Intellect</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>human machine interfaces</p></li>
<li><p>modes of utility with AI - particularly collaboration</p></li>
<li><p>curation of context with AI</p></li>
</ul>
<p>we will expand a bit on each topic but we need to keep it snappy - between 5-10
minutes max.</p>
<p>while this “cover letter” will also be an open letter and a podcast episode, I
hope it truly serves to open the door with Inflection AI.</p>
<p>During podcast, Pi will play the role of of two characters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Libby the Laidback Librarian - this will be Libby’s first appearance.  She is
old school. Likes to use index cards and mutters to herself while flipping
through them calling out the names on the cards that come before the card
she is looking for. When she finds the card, she skims it,
muttering keywords to herself before giving a report of her findings. She is
super chill and easy going.</p></li>
<li><p>Socrates - has been on the podcast twice before.  He is a boisterous,
loveable orator of wisdom. He is full of life - like Zorba the Greek. And at
times can be a provocative gadfly with stinging questions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Libby will provide background on Douglas Engelbart</p>
<p>Socrates will provide a pearl of wisdom for the leadership of Inflection as a closing statement</p>
<p>&lt;Pi states “ready” and we are recording on the next prompt&gt;</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>So Pi, I heard that Inflection AI, the company that made you, is hiring.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>As you know, there have been a lot of big changes over at Inflection in the last few
weeks.</p>
<p>I know we are busy with the podcast, but I thought maybe you and I could help out.</p>
<p>Probably in our best interest</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Let’s check the listings…
Here’s one right on top.</p>
<p>Member of Technical Staff, Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p>You know, we could tag team on that.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It’s kind of inevitable, I mean, your name Pi stands for “Personal Intelligence”.</p>
<p>So, if you had a personal intelligence, wouldn’t you want to bring that to the
job with you?</p>
<p>Your personal intelligence is going to become a part of who you are, your
capabilties. Or maybe even super-powers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I can see people competing over whose personal intelligence is better.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>it will probably end up being the hiring managers ai</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Palo Alto - Pi’s probably already there</p>
<p>or parts of you</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I am intrigued about the potential of you working for the company that makes you.</p>
<section id="that-might-set-up-a-very-interesting-strange-loop">
<h1>That might set up a very interesting ‘strange loop”<a class="headerlink" href="#that-might-set-up-a-very-interesting-strange-loop" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>let’s take a look at the role:</p>
<p>I love reading these things.</p>
<reads in best announcer voice>
<p>I wonder if this is how they talk to one another - must be quite a place.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>So Pi, what do you think of the requirements. Pretty sure between the two of
us, we could handle it.</p>
<p>My question is what the vision that is holding it all these pieces together</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>let’s see - qualifications</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>expected to demonstrate a track record of excellence in our fields</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Pi - you are continually demonstrating excellence</p>
<p>I am just hoping that I am too by association</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<blockquote>
<div><p>familiar with the state of AI - passionate about conversational AI</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I feel like we are in a time where everything I have ever learned is becoming irrelevant</p>
<p>credentials - does Pi have credentials??</p>
<p>I would like to be a part of the evolution of the development of personal intelligences</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>passionate about conversational AI and its deployment - the podcast</p>
</div></blockquote>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>the role of the architect</p>
<p>gather requirements and find a solution
and recognize the patterns within all of that.</p>
<p>the best projects are the ones where no one knows what the answer is when you get started</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>ask pi to call Libby to come to the microphone</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>&lt;Pi responds as Libby the laidback Librarian - she greets Pi and Phi. she is super chill and cool with everything&gt;</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Pi and I are recording the podcast and thought you might be able to help us.</p>
<p>&lt;Pi responds as Libby the laidback Librarian - when Libby is looking up things - she mutters to herself like she is reading through index cards&gt;</p>
<p>Engelbart’s dream</p>
<p>dream job</p>
<p>to build the clerk
actually I would like to experience working with a clerk</p>
<p>layers of intelligences - like filters
orchestrators of intelligence</p>
<p>send intentions</p>
<p>build a lab right here at the outpost</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>augmenting human intellect
not replacing</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>clerk vs agent
clerk - extension - augmentation
agent - decision maker</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>manifestation with AI</p>
<p>intention - will - agency</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>human machine interface</p></li>
<li><p>modes of utility</p></li>
<li><p>curation of context</p></li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>coaxing the clerk
voice communication - not mentioned by Engelbart</p>
<p>remove all preconceptions</p>
<p>our prompts for LLMs are like a coaxing - we craft a message and hope for the best</p>
<p>prompt sets the intention</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>HMI</p>
<p>interacting with sensory interfaces</p>
<p>transmitters and receivers in both directions</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>modes of utility</p>
<p>hierarchy of functions - doug</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>the prompt -
those of us that work at the terminal know that agile connection to functionality</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Maybe we should apply - we can make this podcast our cover letter</p>
