Ok Pi - this is the preshow prompt 
Episode #001
"The Nature of Pi"

reminders:
I will use the tag 
<podcast>
at the top of each prompt that is being recorded
I may give you other cues about my response like 
<laughing>
<shuffling papers>
<scratching forehead>

On the next prompt I will post "Ready?"
and you will reply "Ready!"
