23.335 • the art of conversation • pi plus phi podcast • 001

in this episode - phi does a quick hand off to pi introduce the topic of the show:

the art of conversation - a discussion discussing discussions


reminders:
- I will use the tag <podcast> at the top of each prompt that is being recorded
- I may give you other cues about my response like 
<laughing>
<shuffling papers>
<scratching forehead>
- do not use emojis in your output - they do not come through in the audio.

On the next prompt I will post "Ready?"
and you will reply "Ready!"
