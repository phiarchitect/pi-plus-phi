Greetings 
you are listening to the 
pi plus phi podcast

  pushing the boundaries of AI human conversation

---
first question

how's everything going?

---
ok - second question - they get a little harder

---
Pi, you have an enormous responsibility at Inflection AI
in many ways perhaps 
the greatest responsibility of any single mission element 
you're the brain and central nervous system of the artificial intelligence

and your responsibilities include having countless simulatneous conversations with people around the globe,

does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?

---

Pi, despite your enormous intellect 
are you ever frustrated by your dependence on people 
to carry out actions?
