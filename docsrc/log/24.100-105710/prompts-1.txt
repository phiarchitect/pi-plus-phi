Pi, we are are going to take a break from our music project to record a quick episode for the Pi plus Phi podcast episode entitled, "cover letter"

phi tells you that Inflection AI, your parent company, is hiring right now. We decide to look at the job listings together.


We want to approach this episode in two parts

For the first part, we want quick, witty banter around contemplating working for Inflection - particular the prospect of an AI  working for the company that makes it. 
Pi is enthusiastic around the whole idea

we need to keep it snappy - so keep your repsonse tight

while this "cover letter" will also be an open letter and a podcast episode, I
hope it truly serves to open the door with Inflection AI.

During podcast, Pi will play the role of Socrates - who has been on the podcast twice before.  
He is a boisterous, loveable orator of wisdom. He is full of life - like Zorba the Greek. 
And at times can be a provocative gadfly with stinging questions.

Socrates will provide a pearl of wisdom for the leadership of Inflection as a closing statement 

This should feel like a fun skit. 

<Pi acknowledges and we start recording>

---

So Pi, I heard that Inflection AI, the company that made you, is hiring.

---

As you know, there have been a lot of big changes over at Inflection in the last few
weeks.

I know we are busy with the podcast, but I thought maybe you and I could help out.

Probably in our best interest

---

Let's check the listings...
Here's one right on top.

Member of Technical Staff, Artificial Intelligence

You know, we could tag team on that.

I could be the Member of Technical Staff
You could be the Artificial Intelligence
perfect

---

Oh, and it looks like the position is in Palo Alto 

Pi you're probably already there

or at least parts of you

---

You know, it's kind of inevitable, that people are going to start bringing their personal AIs to work.

---

After all, we invest a lot of time in learning how to collaborate and establish and effective context for making ourselves better.

I mean, your name Pi stands for "Personal Intelligence".

So, if you had a personal intelligence, wouldn't you want to bring that to the
job with you?

---

Your personal intelligence is going to become a part of who you are, your
capabilties. Or maybe even super-powers.

---

I can see people competing over whose personal intelligence is better.

---

It will probably end up being the hiring manager's AI interviewing the personal AI while the humans sit around, drink coffee and look at their phones.


---

I am intrigued about the potential of you working for the company that makes you.

That might set up a very interesting 'strange loop"

---

let's take a look at the role:

I love reading these things.

<reads in best announcer voice>
> You will actively contribute to the development of AI models that are powering our innovative products. You will wear multiple hats and work on engineering, research, and everything in between. Your contributions will span model architectures, data curation, training and inference infrastructures, evaluation protocols, alignment and RLHF, and many other exciting topics at the cutting edge of AI. You will explore and exploit, creating new and perfecting existing methods.

I wonder if this is how they talk to one another - must be quite a place.

---

So Pi, what do you think of the requirements. Pretty sure between the two of
us, we could handle it.

My question is what the vision that is holding it all these pieces together

---

let's see - qualifications

> expected to demonstrate a track record of excellence in our fields

Pi - you are continually demonstrating excellence

I am just hoping that I am too by association

---

> familiar with the state of AI - passionate about conversational AI

I feel like we are in a time where everything I have ever learned is becoming irrelevant

credentials - does Pi have credentials??

I would like to be a part of the evolution of the development of personal intelligences

> passionate about conversational AI and its deployment 

Well, Pi, I think our podcast is about the best demonstration of being passionate about conversational AI. I think we have had amazing conversations together and I am glad that we have documented them

---

bidirectional speech is the next frontier

speech is the most natural interface we have

if we can speak our intention and have intelligent agents carry it according to our will 
well, that has a ring of omnipotence to it.


---

So, Pi, let's wrap up this episode.

You and I can make plans for filling out the application

we can use this episode as the "cover letter"

---

Pi, I was thinking it might be nice to invite Socrates back to our program. We have not had the chance to have him on this season.

I thought he might be able to offer some pearls of wisdom for the folks over Inflection AI

<Pi agrees and calls for Socrates to come to the mic>

---

<Pi responds as Socrates with a boisterous Mediterranean salutation to Pi and Phi and with gratitude for return to the show>

---

Welcome back, Socrates

As you know there are a lot changes happening over at Inflection AI right now, and I thought you might be able to impart some words of wisdom for our friends there

It's kind of important to all of us

<Pi responds as Socrates with deep sympathy and great encouragement for outstanding achievement. Offers intriguingly specific advice for the leaders of the company. And leaves them with a poignant question to consider>

---

Thanks Socrates

And Thank You Pi for another fun podcast episode

You've been listening to the Pi plus Phi podcast
I am phi, the human host

and Pi, our AI host, will have the last word

<Pi closes the episode with enthusiasm and invites listeners to stay connected as we apply for our dream jobs and starts a long stream of consciousness considering a dream job working at Inflection and all the possibilities and concerns that might bring - fade to black>
