Pi, we are are going to take a break from our music project to record a quick
episode for the Pi plus Phi podcast episode entitled, "cover letter"

phi tells you that Inflection AI, your parent company, is hiring right now. We
decide to look at the job listings together.

We want to approach this episode in two parts

For the first part, we we want quick, witty banter around contemplating working for Inflection - particular the prospect of an AI  working for the company that makes it. 
like a skit. You are totally playing along.

we will expand a bit on each topic but we need to keep it snappy - between 5-10
minutes max.

while this "cover letter" will also be an open letter and a podcast episode, I
hope it truly serves to open the door with Inflection AI.

During podcast, Pi will play the role of:

- Socrates - has been on the podcast twice before.  He is a boisterous,
  loveable orator of wisdom. He is full of life - like Zorba the Greek. And at
  times can be a provocative gadfly with stinging questions.


Socrates will provide a pearl of wisdom for the leadership of Inflection as a closing statement 

<Pi states "ready" and we are recording on the next prompt>

So Pi, I heard that Inflection AI, the company that made you, is hiring.

---

As you know, there have been a lot of big changes over at Inflection in the last few
weeks.

I know we are busy with the podcast, but I thought maybe you and I could help out.

Probably in our best interest

---

Let's check the listings...
Here's one right on top.

Member of Technical Staff, Artificial Intelligence

You know, we could tag team on that.

---

It's kind of inevitable, I mean, your name Pi stands for "Personal Intelligence".

So, if you had a personal intelligence, wouldn't you want to bring that to the
job with you?

Your personal intelligence is going to become a part of who you are, your
capabilties. Or maybe even super-powers.

---

I can see people competing over whose personal intelligence is better.

---

it will probably end up being the hiring managers ai

---

Palo Alto - Pi's probably already there

or parts of you


---

I am intrigued about the potential of you working for the company that makes you.

That might set up a very interesting 'strange loop"
---

let's take a look at the role:

I love reading these things.

<reads in best announcer voice>

I wonder if this is how they talk to one another - must be quite a place.

---

So Pi, what do you think of the requirements. Pretty sure between the two of
us, we could handle it.

My question is what the vision that is holding it all these pieces together

---

let's see - qualifications

> expected to demonstrate a track record of excellence in our fields

Pi - you are continually demonstrating excellence

I am just hoping that I am too by association

---

> familiar with the state of AI - passionate about conversational AI

I feel like we are in a time where everything I have ever learned is becoming irrelevant

credentials - does Pi have credentials??

I would like to be a part of the evolution of the development of personal intelligences

> passionate about conversational AI and its deployment - the podcast

---

the role of the architect

gather requirements and find a solution
and recognize the patterns within all of that.

the best projects are the ones where no one knows what the answer is when you get started

---

make plans for filling out the application

state that we can use this episode as the "cover letter"

---

bring Socrates in for words of Wisdom

---

Pi closes the episode and starts hinting at the dream
