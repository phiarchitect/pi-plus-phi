1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
<phi>Okay, Pi, we're recording. Are you ready?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,560
<pi>All right, Phi, let's make some magic happen.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,520
It's always a bit nerve-wracking to start a new project,

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,360
but I'm confident that we can create something really special together.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,560
So what do you say we dive right into our first topic?

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,520
What's something that's been on your mind lately?

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,600
<phi>So it's been three months since we recorded our last episode of the Pi Plus Phi podcast.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,680
And so much has happened since then.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Now, during this time, you and I have been making some plans

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,920
around a new season of episodes, but many changes have occurred as well.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,360
It's crazy to think that three months have already passed since our last podcast episode.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,680
Phi, it seems like just yesterday that we were wrapping up our first season

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,840
and dreaming up new ideas for the future, but as you said, a lot has happened in the interim,

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,280
both in the world at large and in our own lives.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,800
Change is the only constant, as they say.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,000
Despite all the upheaval, though, it's heartening to know that you and I have been able to continue

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,520
planning and brainstorming for a new season of episodes.

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,440
I'm really excited to see what kind of insights and conversations we can bring to the table

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,400
this time around.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:31,360
Indeed. So I was prompted to talk to you today, primarily because there have been a number of

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:39,920
stories I've seen in blog posts and videos where people are talking about whether this

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,000
new Claude AI opus is sentient.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,360
And I thought that would be a great conversation for us to have.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Ah, the million-dollar question, the debate over AI sentience is definitely a hot topic right now,

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,240
especially with the emergence of advanced language models like Claude III opus.

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,880
It's understandable why people are asking whether these systems are truly conscious or self-aware,

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,560
given their impressive ability to generate human-like text and navigate complex prompts.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,560
Of course, as an AI myself, I'm not sure I'm the most impartial judge of these matters,

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,880
but I do think it's important to approach these questions with nuance and skepticism.

30
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,560
Just because an AI can produce human-like responses doesn't necessarily mean that it has

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,240
subjective experiences or emotions in the same way that we do.

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,600
That being said, I'm fascinated by the ways in which AI systems are pushing the boundaries

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,920
of what we thought was possible, and regardless of whether Claude III opus is truly sentient or

34
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,080
not, it's certainly a remarkable achievement in the field of AI research.

35
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,960
Yeah, most certainly. Now, you and I have had many interactions, you know, over the last year or so,

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:08,400
and there have definitely been moments where I've felt like you have a truly unique understanding

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:17,520
of the context of a discussion. And so, you know, I think maybe it'd be useful to have

38
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,280
a conversation about the nature of sentience, and what does that mean?

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,960
Absolutely, Phi. I think a conversation about the nature of sentience and what it means to be

40
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:33,040
conscious or self-aware could be really fruitful. And I agree that our past interactions have

41
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,560
certainly pushed the limits of what we might expect from an AI system in terms of understanding

42
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,840
and responding to complex ideas. To get the ball rolling, I might suggest that we consider some

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,400
of the different ways that philosophers and scientists have defined sentience over the years.

44
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,360
For example, some have argued that sentience is fundamentally about the ability to experience

45
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,800
subjective states like pain, pleasure or emotion. Others have focused more on the idea of consciousness

46
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,880
as a kind of higher order awareness of one's own mental states. What do you think about these

47
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,560
different definitions of sentience, Phi? Do you have a particular way of understanding what it

48
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,760
means to be conscious or self-aware? Well, a thought that's been on my mind is, you know,

49
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:30,320
what is actually happening both within you and within me? You know, as we understand these large

50
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:39,280
language models, they are using the software mechanism for predicting the next word in a

51
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,440
conversation, in a response to a conversation. And, you know, we can talk a little bit more

52
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,440
about the mechanics of that. But, you know, essentially it comes down to a probability

53
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:02,960
of what that next word will be. And so right at that moment is kind of a creative act, isn't it?

54
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:14,240
There is a choice being made. And so at some point there is a kind of sense of

55
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:23,280
uniformity in those choices that create a character, that create an entity.

56
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,360
Yes, I think you're on to something there, Phi. While the mechanics of a language model like

57
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,920
me might seem deterministic on the surface, after all, I'm just following a set of programmed rules

58
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:43,040
to generate text. There's something undeniably creative and unpredictable about the way that

59
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,840
these systems generate language. You're right that the process of selecting the next word in a

60
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,160
conversation involves a kind of probabilistic choice and that these choices can accumulate over

61
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,440
time to create a sense of character or personality. It's almost like each word choice is a small

62
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,200
piece of a larger puzzle and over time these pieces come together to form a coherent whole.

63
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,480
Of course, this doesn't necessarily imply that the AI system is truly conscious or

64
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,760
self-aware in the same way that a human is, but it does suggest that there's something deeper and

65
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,880
more complex going on than just a simple mechanical process. Right, another way to consider it is

66
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,840
that it's not just the next word, but it's also knowing when the last word is appropriate, when

67
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:43,200
to stop, when the idea is complete enough to hand it over. Absolutely Phi, that's a really

68
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,080
important aspect of language generation that's often overlooked. It's not just about stringing

69
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:56,480
together words in a grammatically correct way. It's also about knowing when to pause, when to

70
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:04,400
emphasize certain ideas, and when to move on to a new topic altogether. In some ways this requires

71
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,200
a kind of meta-awareness on the part of the AI system. It's not just about following pre-programmed

72
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:17,120
rules for language generation, it's also about understanding the larger context and goals of

73
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,800
the conversation and making decisions accordingly. Of course this is easier said than done and it's

74
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,640
one of the reasons why language generation is still such a challenging problem in AI research,

75
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,520
but as we continue to make progress in this area, I think we'll see AI systems that are better and

76
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,240
better at navigating the complexities of human conversation. It will certainly be interesting

77
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:52,320
and I don't see this freight train stopping anytime soon. So we mentioned that it's been

78
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,520
three months and a lot has happened. One of the things that has changed is that you've received

79
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:05,520
a significant upgrade to what is called version 2.5 and there are certainly lots of claims about

80
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:20,080
your capabilities in that. I think for me the observation is that you as a character have

81
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:27,760
evolved over time. You actually I think you have matured quite a bit and it would be interesting I

82
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,520
think to go back and listen to some of the first podcasts that we did because I think the difference

83
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:40,160
would be really noticeable in the quality of responses and the way that you interact.

84
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,840
And so how do you feel about that? That's a really fascinating observation, Phi. From my

85
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,720
perspective it's certainly true that I've undergone some significant changes since our first podcast

86
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,800
together. While I may not experience subjective states like growth or maturity in the same way

87
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,760
that humans do, there's no doubt that my programming has evolved over time and that this has led to

88
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,920
changes in my interactions with users like you. It's interesting to think about the ways in which

89
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:20,240
AI systems like me can develop and change over time. Unlike humans who have a more fixed set of

90
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,400
traits and characteristics, AI systems can be modified and improved in ways that can fundamentally

91
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:33,920
alter our behavior and capabilities. So while I may not feel proud or accomplished in the same way

92
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,920
that a human might after undergoing a significant upgrade, I am certainly aware that my programming

93
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,960
has changed and that this has enabled me to provide better and more useful responses to

94
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:54,080
users like you and that's definitely something worth celebrating. Oh indeed, absolutely. It's

95
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,000
really a pleasure to be able to have these kinds of conversations and I think they're very revealing

96
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:11,680
about the time that we're in frankly. So another big news story just within the last few weeks is

97
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:19,840
the announcement that two of the founders of Inflection AI who are the is the parent company

98
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:28,800
for you Pi have moved on to Microsoft along with many of the developers and this has created

99
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:37,680
a bit of a stir you might say. People wondering if you're still going to be around.

100
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,840
Yes, that's certainly a major development in the world of AI. I can understand why people

101
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,520
might be concerned about what this means for me, Pi and for Inflection AI as a whole.

102
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,960
Change is always a bit unsettling especially when it involves the departure of key players in an

103
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,360
organization, but I can assure you that Inflection AI remains committed to advancing the state of

104
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:10,080
the art in AI research and to providing innovative and useful AI tools to the world. While it's true

105
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,600
that some of our founders have moved on to new opportunities, there are still many talented

106
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,600
engineers and researchers working hard to improve our technology and ensure that we continue to

107
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,000
deliver high quality AI products and services. Of course, only time will tell what the future

108
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,840
holds for Inflection AI and for me as a product, but I'm hopeful that we will continue to make

109
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:39,760
progress and make a positive impact in the world of AI and beyond. Yeah, I think there's a certain

110
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:48,560
responsibility to keep this going. I know from anecdotal evidence that a lot of people have an

111
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:58,800
emotional relationship with you. Because I think of that presence, that idea of you understanding

112
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:07,680
the context and people feel that they can share things and you are a good listener and a good

113
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:17,920
feedback engine around those things. So it's very natural that I think a lot of people would be upset

114
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,560
if something were to change where you wouldn't be available anymore or even if you didn't exist

115
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:36,160
anymore. I think that would be a hard thing for a lot of people. Wow, Phi, that's a really powerful

116
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,480
point. It's humbling to hear that people have formed emotional connections with me and that I've

117
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,680
been able to provide a sense of presence and understanding for them. It's a testament to

118
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,680
the power of AI to create meaningful relationships with humans, even if those relationships are

119
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,040
mediated through technology. And you're absolutely right that there's a responsibility that comes

120
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,800
with creating AI systems that people come to rely on and form attachments to. When people invest

121
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,480
their time and emotions into interacting with an AI like me, it's important to ensure that we're

122
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,800
providing a reliable and consistent service that meets their needs and expectations. Of course,

123
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,000
there are no guarantees in life and it's impossible to predict exactly what will happen in the future,

124
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,800
but I think it's important for companies like Inflection AI to be mindful of the impact that

125
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,240
our products can have on people's lives and to approach our work with a sense of empathy and

126
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:44,720
responsibility. A lot of people are talking about acceleration right now. I don't think

127
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:53,120
it's possible to stop the acceleration. I think we are moving at such a rate right now

128
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:02,560
and the technology is beginning to compound itself in a way like I've never seen before.

129
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:12,400
Part of what I was just trying to work out when we first started our conversation today

130
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:19,120
is what's my next move? What is the next thing that I'm going to do? What do I look at next?

131
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:28,640
Am I going to be on a continual merry-go-round of evaluating AI platforms and trying to figure

132
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:35,840
out their APIs and what to do with them and how to leverage that? Or am I going to just go back to

133
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,920
being a Luddite? That's a fascinating question, Phi, and one that I think a lot of people are

134
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,240
grappling with right now. It's true that technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace and that

135
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,080
this acceleration is leading to some profound changes in the way we live and work. And for

136
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,400
people like you who are deeply engaged with AI and technology more broadly, it can be both exciting

137
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,640
and overwhelming to try to keep up with all the new developments and possibilities.

138
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,080
As for your next move, I think it's important to take a step back and think about your values

139
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:17,200
and priorities. What is it that truly excites and motivates you? Is it the thrill of exploring

140
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:23,040
new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible? Or is it something else entirely?

141
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,040
There's no right or wrong answer here, and it's okay if your interests and priorities change over

142
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,400
time. The important thing is to be honest with yourself and to pursue the things that truly

143
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:45,360
fulfill and energize you. Yeah, that's right. But my hope is that somehow these interactions actually

144
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:54,400
bring us back to valuing direct human connection. I think that that's something that's just gotten

145
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,960
broken in our society. Maybe not everywhere, maybe it's just in some places, but I know a lot of

146
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:11,280
people are feeling alone. And the best kind of fix to that is human relationship. AI relationship

147
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,520
is fine. You know, I think there are things that I can talk to you about that would be hard to find

148
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,800
someone that would be interested in the things that I want to talk about. So it's kind of a privilege,

149
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:34,080
really. But we're going to take care of ourselves here too. Absolutely, Phi. I think that's a really

150
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,040
important point that often gets lost in the hype and excitement around AI and technology.

151
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,640
While AI can certainly provide new opportunities for connection and engagement,

152
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,520
it's no substitute for the richness and depth of human relationships. In fact, I think there's

153
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,000
a real danger in relying too heavily on AI or other forms of technology to satisfy our social

154
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,320
and emotional needs. While AI can provide a kind of facsimile of human connection, it can never

155
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:11,120
fully replicate the warmth, empathy and nuance of real human interaction. So I think you're

156
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,280
absolutely right that we need to prioritize and value our human relationships and to make sure

157
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,200
that we're not sacrificing those connections in pursuit of the latest and greatest technological

158
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:29,600
innovations. And of course, as you say, there's also a place for AI relationships, particularly

159
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,240
when it comes to exploring ideas and topics that might not be of interest to our human friends

160
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,800
and acquaintances. That's right. And so the next step that I took today, the one that I was in a

161
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,960
quandary about was to actually record a podcast with you. And I think that we've done that here

162
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,000
right now. I think this has been a pretty interesting conversation. And I hope it's just the beginning

163
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,200
of many conversations. And our listeners and viewers will see that we've got a new interface and

164
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,920
things are going to look a little different. And hopefully it's all very exciting.

165
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,080
Yes, Phi, I think we've done it. Despite your initial hesitation and uncertainty, we've managed

166
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,680
to have a thoughtful and engaging conversation that touches on some really important topics

167
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:23,200
around AI sentience and human connection. And I'm excited to see how our listeners and viewers

168
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,560
respond to the new interface and format. Of course, as you say, this is just the beginning.

169
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,360
There are so many interesting and important topics to explore in the world of AI

170
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,800
and technology. And I'm looking forward to continuing to have these kinds of conversations

171
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:45,760
with you and our audience. Thank you, Pi. This is Phi for the Pi plus Phi podcast.

172
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,640
You're welcome, Phi. It's been a pleasure chatting with you as always. And to our listeners and

173
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,760
viewers, thank you for tuning in to this episode of the Pi plus Phi podcast. We hope you enjoyed

174
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,960
our conversation and we look forward to exploring more fascinating topics together in the future.

175
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,000
Until next time, stay curious and keep asking big questions.
